- 👋 Hi, I’m @felixg3
- 👀 I’m interested in GNU/Linux (especially openSUSE, Fedora, Debian) and ThinkPads, currently not because of €$₹—using a Yoga Slim 7 ProX 82TL (which I cordially call a th0nkp4d) and a MBA 2020 M1 for work
- 🌱 I’m currently a graduate student of Political Science, Development Economics and Geography in South Asia at the Ruprecht-Karls-University Heidelberg
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research on Hindu nationalism, development economics and remote sensing
- 📫 How to reach me: felix {at} giessmann {dot} net
